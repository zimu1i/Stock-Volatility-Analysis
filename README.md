# Stock Volatility Explorer 🚀

## Overview 📝
This project analyzes the volatility behavior of selected U.S. equities by computing rolling historical volatility and comparing stock-level risk relative to the overall market.
The goal is to understand how different stocks behave under normal and stress (high-volatility) market regimes.

## Motivation 📚
Volatility is a key measure of financial risk. While some stocks are inherently volatile, others become risky only during periods.
